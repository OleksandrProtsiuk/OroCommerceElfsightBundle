## Content Blocks

By default, you can add Elfsight widgets to any place that supports content widgets: landing pages, 
product and category descriptions, predefined content blocks. 

This bundle adds new content blocks to different pages all over the application, so you can add Elfsight 
widgets to any of that blocks. Some Elfsight widgets that are always presented on screen (e.g. live chat, popup) 
can be added to any block. Other widgets that have to be added to the right place on the page (e.g. forms, social feeds)
should be added to the right content block.

Here are all pages with new content blocks added to them.
